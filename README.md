In this project, I used Python Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze and few business questions about 12 months of sales Data.

Concatenated these 12 months data into a single dataframe. Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to get the answer of these few questions.

Q1: Best month for sales?
Q2: Which city had the highest sales?
Q3: What time should we display our advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchase?
Q4: Which products are most often sold together?
Q5: Which product had the highest order count?
